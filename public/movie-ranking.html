<h3>The Matrix Trilogy</h3>
<p>
Used to love them but have kinda soured on them as the years have gone on.<br />
Matrix 1: Still Legit.<br />
Matrix 2: Also still pretty good. Good action.<br />
Matrix 3: Eh.<br />
</p>
<h3>A Few Good Men</h3>
<p>Boss Film. Every scene is great. Can't get away.</p>
<h3>Heat</h3>
